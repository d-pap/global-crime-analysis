## Introduction

Gun ownership levels and their potential relationship with crime and safety have been a topic of interest and debate for many years. The central question revolves around whether higher levels of gun ownership contribute to increased crime rates or act as a deterrent, promoting safety. This research paper aims to examine the global landscape of gun ownership, crime, and safety indices, and investigate how these factors vary.

In this study, we begin by visually exploring the data through a series of graphs and numerical summaries that highlight the relationship between gun ownership and crime index across different regions. These visualizations offer a preliminary understanding of global patterns and potential correlations between gun ownership and crime. To further examine these patterns, we perform a bootstrap confidence interval analysis and a hypothesis test to assess if there are significant differences in crime levels between countries with high and low numbers of guns.

Finally, we fit and compare two regression models to evaluate the impact of regional factors and  unregistered guns on crime indices. These models provide insights into the factors that may contribute to crime and the potential role of gun ownership in shaping crime and safety landscapes. By conducting this comprehensive analysis, we aim to provide a deeper understanding of the complex relationship between gun ownership, crime, and safety around the world.

***Note: This project seeks to maintain neutrality, avoiding any bias towards or against guns, and purely aims to understand the patterns present in the data.***
