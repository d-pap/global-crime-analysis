## Introduction

Gun ownership levels and their potential relationship with crime and safety have been a topic of interest and debate for many years. The central question revolves around whether higher levels of gun ownership contribute to increased crime rates or act as a deterrent, promoting safety. This research paper aims to examine the global landscape of gun ownership, crime, and safety indices, and investigate how these factors vary. *Please keep in mind this project seeks to maintain neutrality, avoiding any bias towards or against guns, and purely aims to understand the patterns present in the data.*

In this study, we begin by visually exploring the data through a series of graphs and numerical summaries that highlight the relationship between gun ownership and crime index across different regions. These visualizations offer a preliminary understanding of global patterns and potential correlations between gun ownership and crime. To further examine these patterns, we perform a bootstrap confidence interval analysis and a hypothesis test to assess if there are significant differences in crime levels between countries with high and low numbers of guns.

Finally, we fit and compare two regression models to evaluate the impact of regional factors and  unregistered guns on crime indices. These models provide insights into the factors that may contribute to crime and the potential role of gun ownership in shaping crime and safety landscapes. By conducting this comprehensive analysis, we aim to provide a deeper understanding of the complex relationship between gun ownership, crime, and safety around the world.

## Conclusion

In our initial exploratory data analysis, we hypothesized a positive correlation between the number of unregistered guns and crime index scores based on the findings in our graphs. However, our findings suggests that this relationship is not as straightforward. We employed a bootstrapping approach by categorizing countries into two groups based on their median guns per capita: high gun countries and low gun countries and compared the mean crime index scores for each group. While the bootstrap results initially suggested that high gun countries may have a lower crime index score, the overlapping confidence intervals for both groups indicated the difference in means is not statistically significant. To support our conclusion, we performed a two-sample t-test, which yielded a p-value of 0.1128, exceeding the 0.05 significance level. Consequently, we failed to reject the null hypothesis that the mean crime index score for high gun countries is the same as that of low gun countries. Furthermore, our linear regression analysis revealed that the number of unregistered guns does not significantly impact the crime index score, supporting our earlier findings that the number of guns alone does not determine a country’s crime index score. In summary, our results reveal that a multitude of factors contribute to a country’s crime index score, with the number of guns and unregistered guns representing only a fraction of the influencing variables.
